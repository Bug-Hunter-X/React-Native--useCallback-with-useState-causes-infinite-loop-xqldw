This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that uses the `useState` hook.  It results in an infinite loop. The root cause is that the inner function's closure changes on every render, resulting in a new function reference every time, even if the state values haven't changed.  This forces `useCallback` to return a new function on each render, making the dependency array infinite.
